```

You can continue to work with the analyses you did in the previous set of exercises. 

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Re-use your analysis from the previous set of exercises and run an interaction model between your IV and the other covariate. Plot the interaction as a coefficient plot.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
For the coefficient plot, you can use the `easystats` packages we have used in the lecture. 
```

```{r first-exercise, solution = TRUE}
library(dplyr)
library(haven)
library(parameters)
library(performance)
library(see)

allbus_2021_dvII_2 <- 
  read_spss("./data/allbus_2021/ZA5280_v1-0-0.sav") %>% 
  mutate(political_orientation = as.numeric(pa01))
  
linear_model_interaction <-
  lm(
    political_orientation ~ age * eastwest,
    data = allbus_2021_dvII_2
  )

model_parameters(linear_model_interaction) %>% 
  plot()
```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Imagine that you want to use the plot in a publication. Color figures usually cost extra. So, to save some money, try to make let the plot "turn grey".
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
Remember that the `easytats` plots are based on `ggplot2`. You could choose from one of `ggplot2`'s built-in themes from this list: https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html. In another step, you could adjust the color of the scale, e.g., with `scale_colour_grey()`. Be creative. 
```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE}
model_parameters(linear_model_interaction) %>% 
  plot() +
  scale_colour_grey(start = 0,
                    end = .5,
                    guide = "none") +
  theme_minimal()
```

```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Plot the interaction effect as a prediction.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
For this purpose, you need the `plot_model()` function from `sjPlot`.
```

```{r third-exercise, solution = TRUE}
library(sjPlot)

plot_model(
  linear_model_interaction,
  type = "int"
)
```
