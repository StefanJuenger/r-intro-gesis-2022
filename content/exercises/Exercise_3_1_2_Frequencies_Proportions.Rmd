```{r child = "content/config/exercises_setup.Rmd"}
```

We will continue to work with the same data as in the previous set of exercises. By now, you should (hopefully) have saved them as an `.rds` file and, hence, be able to easily load them (in case they are not already/still in your current `R` workspace/working environment).
This time, in addition to `base R` and the `tidyverse`, we also need the `janitor` package.

```{r libraries, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

```{r load}
allbus_2021_eda <- readRDS("./data/allbus_2021_eda.rds")
```

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Using `base R`, print a simple table with the frequencies of the variable `agec`. Also include the counts for missing values.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The argument for including missing values in the resulting table is `useNA = "always"`.
```

```{r first-exercise, solution = TRUE}
table(allbus_2021_eda$agec, useNA = "always")
```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Next, use a combination of `base R` functions to get the proportions for the variable `sex` rounded to four decimal places.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You need to wrap `table()` into two other functions: One for creating the proportion table and another one for rounding the decimal places.
```

```{r second-exercise, solution = TRUE}
round(prop.table(table(allbus_2021_eda$sex)), 4)
```

```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Now, use functions from the `dplyr` package to get the frequencies and proportions for the `sex` variable (without worrying about the number of decimal places this time).
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
We first need to count the cases and then transform the resulting variable to get proportions.
```

```{r third-exercise, solution = TRUE}
allbus_2021_eda %>% 
  count(sex) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n/sum(n)) %>% 
  ungroup()
```

```{block, box.title = "4", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
As a final exercise, use a function from the `janitor` package to display the counts and percentages for the categories in the `agec` variable. The output sbe rounded to 3 decimal places and include percentage signs.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You can format the `tabyl()` output using the `adorn_pct_formatting` function.
```

```{r fourth-exercise, solution = TRUE}
allbus_2021_eda %>% 
  tabyl(agec) %>% 
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 3, 
                       affix_sign = TRUE)
```
